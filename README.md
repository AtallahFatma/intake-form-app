# Client Intake Application

A multi-step onboarding flow built using a reusable Design System.

This project demonstrates how a standalone Design System can be consumed
in a real product environment to build accessible, composable, and scalable UI flows.

This application consumes the shared Design System:

All form components, layout primitives, and accessibility rules
come from the Design System.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

- Real-world usage of a component library
- Accessible multi-step form patterns
- Controlled form state management
- Validation and error handling
- Clean separation between UI primitives and product logic

---

## 🧱 Architecture

### Design System (external dependency)

Provides:
- Button
- Input
- Textarea
- Select
- FormField
- Tokens (colors, spacing..)
- Accessibility guarantees

### Intake App (this repository)

Provides:
- Step logic
- Navigation
- Validation
- Composition of DS primitives into product flows

## ♿ Accessibility

Accessibility is enforced by the Design System.

This application:

- Uses visible labels via `FormField
- Sets `aria-invalid` for invalid inputs
- Links error messages using `aria-describedby`
- Relies on native form semantics
- Supports keyboard navigation

Accessibility is opt-out only through deliberate misuse.

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

- Small, composable steps
- Explicit validation logic
- Predictable state handling
- No hidden magic
- Separation of concerns

The intake app does not redefine UI behavior.
It consumes primitives and composes them.
